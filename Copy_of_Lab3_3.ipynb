        "*   Starting with a vague prompt like \"Generate python code to calculate power bill\" results in a highly simplified and inaccurate code snippet that only considers a flat rate multiplied by consumption. It lacks essential real-world billing components such as fixed charges, tiered rates, taxes, and surcharges.\n",
        "*   Refining the prompt by specifying inputs like energy consumption and a flat tariff rate leads to a code snippet that correctly performs this basic multiplication but still omits other crucial billing elements.\n",
        "*   Further refining the prompt to include details about fixed charges and specifying that billing details should be provided in a dictionary allows for the generation of code that correctly incorporates both a fixed charge and a usage-based rate, making the calculation more realistic than a simple flat-rate model.\n",
        "*   The analysis of the refined code shows that using dictionary access (specifically `.get()`) is a robust way to handle multiple billing components, although the code still does not cover all complexities like tiered rates, taxes, or time-of-use rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   To generate truly accurate power bill calculation code, the prompt needs to be highly detailed, specifying the exact billing structure, including all applicable fixed charges, tiered rates, taxes, and potential time-of-use variations relevant to a specific utility or region.\n",
        "*   A next step could involve refining the prompt further to include tiered rates, requiring the code to implement conditional logic or lookups based on consumption levels to apply different rates to different consumption blocks.\n"
